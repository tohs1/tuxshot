# TuxShot
**Play OneShot on Linux!**

Fixes for the Linux version of OneShot.

This does not apply to World Machine Edition, which already works on Linux through Proton.

Also, this does not work with the itch version of OneShot.

To patch OneShot you must open the terminal and paste this:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tohs1/tuxshot/main/script.sh | bash
```
If your distribution is Ubuntu, then you will probably need to install curl first:
```
sudo apt install curl -y
```
